# HW1 App

## Brief Working of App
This is a simple React Native app that allows users to add and remove items from a list.
Here, the users can add elements to the list by inserting text into the input textbox and pressing Add Element button.
The users can remove particular item in the list by pressing Remove button which is beside the item.
And, the users can check the number of items in the list at the bottom of the screen.

## Time Taken

I took about 3 hours to complete this assignment.

## Challeneges Faced

I had challenges understanding the concept of States and ran into problems when dealing with arrays. After looking at sample codes written by others I got a good idea of how it works and used the same concept to develop the logic of the app correctly.
I found Android Studio eats up lots of RAM and slows down my development time. The TA showed me using "snack.expo.dev" or VS Code which helped me with this assignment.
