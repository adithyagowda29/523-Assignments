# HW2 App

## Brief Working of App
This is a simple React Native app that allows users to capture images and display images on the app from the phone storage. <br>
Here, the users can capture images by pressing "Take Photo" button. <br>
The users can change between Back and Front Camera with the help of "Flip Camera" button. <br>
And, the users can also import the photos from storage to display them on app with the help of "Import Photo" button. <br>

## Time Taken

I took about 3 hours to complete this assignment.

## Challeneges Faced

I had lot of library errors setting up this app with the react-native-camera. As suggested, I started working with expo-camera and everything worked good. <br>
