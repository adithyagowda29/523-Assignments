# HW2 App

## Brief Working of App
This is a simple React Native app that allows users to view weather information of a particular location <br>
Here, the users by default will see the weather information of the current location. <br>
The users can enter the location name in the text input field and get the weather information of it with the help of "Get Weather" button. <br>
And, if the location is not valid, then the texts show up as "N/A" <br>

## Time Taken

I took about 3 hours to complete this assignment.

## Challeneges Faced

I had lot of issues with developing this on Snack website since I could not find Geolocation library version compatible with the Expo version being used. Hence, I started working locally on PC and everything worked good. <br>
